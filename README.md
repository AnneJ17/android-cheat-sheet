# Android Cheat Sheet

* **LiveData, MutableLiveData and MediatorLiveData**

  The below relation is taken from [Android Developer Site](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/MediatorLiveData)
  ```java.lang.Object
   ↳	android.arch.lifecycle.LiveData<T>
 	   ↳	android.arch.lifecycle.MutableLiveData<T>
 	 	   ↳	android.arch.lifecycle.MediatorLiveData<T> 
  ```
  * **LiveData** is an observable data holder class. Unlike regular observable, it is lifecycle-aware meaning it respects the lifecycle of activities, fragments, or services. It notifies Observer objects when the lifecycle state changes. LiveData has no public method to modify it's data. LiveData is an abstract class with protected setValue and postVlaue methods. We will have to use MutableLiveData to modify data. <br>LiveData is used to make the task of the ViewModel easier. The best part about LiveData is that the data will not be updated when the view is in background thus avoiding lot of crashes at runtime. 
  * **MutableLiveData** is a subclass of LiveData which is used for some of it's properties (setValue/postValue) and using these properties we can easily notify the UI when onChanged() is called. With MutableLiveData, setValue() and postValue() are publically available. setValue() - update the LiveData object from the main thread, postValue() - executed in the worker thread and main thread not preferred as it's a bit slower than setValue. 
  * **MediatorLiveData** is a subclass of MutableLiveData and therefore can access every property of MutableLiveData as well as LiveData. And when to use MediatorLiveData over MutableLiveData is demonstarted in this example - For instance, If we want to merge emissions of liveData1 and liveData2 instances into one object: liveDataMerger(a MediatorLivData object), then, liveData1 and liveData2 will become sources for the liveDataMerger and every time onChanged callback is called for either of them, we set a new value in liveDataMerger (by using addSource()). Another example, you want to display two SeekBars on two different fragments(Fragment1 and Fragment2) and you also want them to be synced when operating from Fragment1.
  
* **Advantages of using LiveData**
  - <ins>No memory leaks</ins>: Observers are bound to Lifecycle objects and clean up after themselves when their associated lifecycle is destroyed.
  - <ins>Views always get the upto date data</ins>: If a lifecycle becomes inactive, it receives the latest data upon becoming active again
  - <ins>No crash due to stopped activity</ins>: If the observer's lifecycle is inactive, it doesn’t receive any LiveData events.
  
* **LiveData vs RxJava**

  LiveData is somewhat similar to RxJava except that LiveData is lifecycle aware. LiveData excel on ViewModel layer, with its tight integration with Android lifecycles and ViewModel. RxJava provide more capabilities in transformations. We use RxJava in data source and repository layers, and it's transformed into LiveData (using LiveDataReactiveStreams) in ViewModels (before exposing data to activities/fragments).
  
* **How does LiveData in the ViewModel update the Activity?**

  When we register the Observer in our Activity, we need to override the method onChanged(). The method onChanged() would get trigger whenever the LiveData is changed. Thus in the onChanged(), we can update the changed LiveData onto the View.
